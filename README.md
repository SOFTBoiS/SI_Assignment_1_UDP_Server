### Usage  
**First be sure that the server is up and running!**  

Call the `UDPClient.java" file with two command line arguements:  
1. The server IP.  
2. The file path to the .jpg image you wish to transfer to the server.
example:  
`java UDPClient.java 192.168.0.101 C:\Example\Destination.jpg`
